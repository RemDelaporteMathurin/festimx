# FESTIMx

This is the (for now rather empty) repo for the next generation of FESTIM based on DOLFINx.

Roadmap:

- Implementing the current FESTIM features
- Adding subdomains classes

See the tasks [here](https://github.com/users/RemDelaporteMathurin/projects/5).

Ideas:
- multiple diffusing species
- better handling of conservation of chemical potential
